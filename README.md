# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. It aims to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral, making it valuable for understanding public sentiment in various domains, such as product reviews, social media posts, or customer feedback.

The process begins with *data collection, often from social platforms like Twitter or Facebook, or from review websites. **Data preprocessing* follows, which includes cleaning the text by removing irrelevant characters, stop words, and converting text to lowercase. *Feature extraction* involves transforming the text into a format that machine learning models can interpret, such as using bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT.

Machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), or more advanced models like neural networks, are then trained to classify the sentiments based on labeled data. These models learn patterns that associate specific words or phrases with positive or negative sentiments.

Sentiment analysis is widely applied in fields like marketing, customer service, and political analysis to gauge public opinion, monitor brand perception, and inform business strategies, providing actionable insights into trends and attitudes.
